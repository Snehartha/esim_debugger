# ðŸ”§ eSim AI-Powered Debugging Tool

This project is an **AI-assisted command-line tool** that helps **eSim users** debug their circuits by analyzing:

-  Netlist files
-  Simulation error logs

It provides both:
-  **Rule-based suggestions** (hardcoded logic for known issues)
-  **AI-generated suggestions** (via OpenAI GPT integration)




##  Features Implemented

-  Netlist Analysis Engine  
-  Error Log Analyzer  
-  Rule-Based Suggestion Engine  
-  **AI-Powered Suggestion Engine** using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo  
-  API Error Handling (e.g., missing key, quota exceeded)



## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- An OpenAI API key (for AI suggestions)  
- The following packages:

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
